# Dog-Vision-
This is an end-to-end Deep Learning project that uses unstructured data to build a multi-class image classifier using TensorFlow 2.15 and TensorFlow Hub.
The model we are using for this classifier project is MobileNet v2.

The objective of this project is to identify the breed of a dog , given the image of a dog.
The data we're using is from Kaggle's dog breed identification competition - https://www.kaggle.com/c/dog-breed-identification/data
